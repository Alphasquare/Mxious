Conflicts
===============
Currently there is an ongoing conflict with any Auth class installed from PEAR. Most XAMPP installations come with this by default, therefore causing exceptions. Please remove this library, in the Linux case the path to the file is /opt/lampp/lib/php/Auth.php. Using root privileges delete the whole file, preferably erase it's contents.


Social
===============
Check out the website `alphasquare.us` for social discussion of Mxious.

Warning
===============

Things in the ``development`` branch are extremely unstable. Not for production. Please use files from ``master`` branch instead.

Setup
===============

To set it up, just download the source and place it anywhere, preferably the root.
Then, you can develop and extend it. 

Extend
===============
The wiki will expand on this. 

Documentation

Documentation will come when enough code has been implemented to come up with a sizable amount of documentation.
