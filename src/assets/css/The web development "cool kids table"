The web development "cool kids table"

Many developers absolutely despise languages like PHP for no reason whatsoever, however
every language has its flaws. Recently due to the popularity of other languages for development,
a social phenomenon has been taking place in the programming world and I call it...
The "high school cool kids table".

Many people hate PHP just because they follow the current and do what they hear from others who
have heard the same thing from the "cool kids in development". However, PHP is a great language
to get started in web development. It has its flaws, like any other language, but it definitely makes
work so much simpler. For example, things that might take you dozens of lines in languages like Python,
are most probably built in functions already. In fact, there's a motto already in the community:
"If you can think of it, it's probably already in PHP". This is great, however for the people who don't like
bloat it can sound awful. That is one downside of PHP, there are too many functions for different things. Also,
their naming conventions are pretty bad, you can find functions in camel-case and underscores all the time. 

Resuming, most of the hate on PHP is usually caused by the phenomenon I call "the cool kids table". People like
fitting in. People like feeling comfortable. And that's how the group hate starts.
